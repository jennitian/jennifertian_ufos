# UFO Sightings
module 11 challenge
## Goals
For this project the goal is to create an html page that can filter a data table of reported UFO sightings based on different criteria. To do this, I used javascript and css to create and style the functionality of the web page.
## Future Directions
An interesting way to develop this project could be to grouping the sightings by category. An example of this would be to group the sightings by type to track certain types of sightings like "light sightings" "circle sightings" to look at similarities and track sightings across the world.
